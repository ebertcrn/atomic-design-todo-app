## 🏗️ Architectural Deep Dive: Atomic Design in Action

Our application's structure is a direct reflection of the Atomic Design methodology, breaking down the UI into increasingly complex components. This approach significantly boosts reusability and simplifies maintenance.

### Our Component Hierarchy:

1.  **Atoms**: The fundamental building blocks.
    *   `Button`
    *   `Checkbox`
    *   `Input`

2.  **Molecules**: Groups of atoms functioning together as a unit.
    *   `Side-bar-menu`
    *   `Task-item`
    *   `Task-item-add`
    *   `Task-item-edit`
    *   `Task-list`

3.  **Organisms**: Complex components composed of molecules and/or atoms, forming distinct sections of an interface.
    *   `Header`
    *   `Task`

4.  **Templates/Models**: Page-level objects that place organisms and molecules into a layout.
    *   `TaskModel`

5.  **Pages**: Instances of templates with real content, representing specific views of the application.
    *   `Todo-page`

## 💡 Key Architectural Decisions & Justifications

We made several deliberate choices during development to ensure the project's robustness and future-readiness:

### 1. Embracing Atomic Design

**Decision**: To structure the entire project using Atomic Design principles.

**Why**: This wasn't just a trend; it was a strategic move. By separating components into Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms, we achieved:
*   **Unparalleled Reusability**: Components can be easily swapped and reused across different parts of the application, saving development time and ensuring consistency.
*   **Simplified Maintenance**: A small change at the Atom level propagates cleanly throughout the project, minimizing unexpected side effects and making updates a breeze.
*   **Clearer Collaboration**: A shared vocabulary for UI elements makes it easier for designers and developers to communicate and build together.

### 2. Standalone Components over NgModules

**Decision**: To utilize Angular's Standalone Components.

**Why**: This aligns with the official direction of Angular development, offering:
*   **Reduced Boilerplate**: Less code to write and manage, leading to cleaner, more focused components.
*   **Improved Tree-Shaking**: Smaller bundle sizes and faster load times.
*   **Future-Proofing**: Staying ahead with Angular's evolving best practices.

### 3. Reactive State Management with RxJS

**Decision**: To use RxJS with `BehaviorSubject` for managing application state.

**Why**: RxJS provides a powerful and flexible way to handle asynchronous data streams and state changes. `BehaviorSubject` is particularly useful for managing the current state of our tasks, allowing components to react efficiently to updates.

**Implementation Snippet**:
```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class TaskService {
  private tasks = new BehaviorSubject<TaskModel[]>([]);
  tasks$ = this.tasks.asObservable();
  // ... other methods to manipulate tasks
}
```

### 4. Local Storage for Data Persistence

**Decision**: To use the browser's `localStorage` API to persist tasks.

**Why**: This ensures that user-created tasks are saved locally and remain available even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser. It provides a seamless and reliable user experience without requiring a backend server.

**Implementation Snippet**:
```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class StorageService {
  private storage: Storage;

  constructor() {
    this.storage = localStorage;
  }

  setItem(key: string, value: TaskModel[]): void {
    this.storage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  }

  getItem(key: string): TaskModel[] | null {
    const item = this.storage.getItem(key);
    return item ? JSON.parse(item) : null;
  }
}
```

### 5. Mobile-First CSS Architecture with SCSS & BEM

**Decision**: To implement a mobile-first CSS strategy using SCSS and the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology.

**Why**: This combination ensures our styling is:
*   **Optimized for Performance**: Starting with mobile styles and progressively enhancing for larger screens leads to faster load times on mobile devices.
*   **Highly Maintainable**: BEM provides a clear, predictable naming convention for CSS classes, making it easy to understand and modify styles.
*   **Scalable**: SCSS variables and mixins allow for reusable styles and easier theme management.

### 6. Type-Safe Interfaces with TypeScript

**Decision**: To enforce strict TypeScript interfaces for all data structures.

**Why**: TypeScript is a cornerstone of this project, providing:
*   **Enhanced Type Safety**: Catching errors at compile-time rather than runtime, leading to more robust code.
*   **Superior Developer Experience**: IntelliSense and autocompletion make coding faster and less error-prone.
*   **Self-Documenting Code**: Interfaces clearly define data shapes, serving as excellent documentation for the project.

**Implementation Snippet**:
```typescript
export interface TaskModel {
  readonly id: string;
  name: string;
  isCompleted: boolean;
}
```

### 7. Comprehensive Unit Testing

**Decision**: To implement unit tests for Atomic Design components, especially Atoms, using Karma and Jasmine.

**Why**: Unit testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability of our smallest, most fundamental UI elements. By testing Atoms rigorously, we build a strong foundation for the entire application. Karma and Jasmine provide a robust framework for this, allowing us to isolate components and verify their behavior precisely.
